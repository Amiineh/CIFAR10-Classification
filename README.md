# CIFAR10-Classification
This project is a Deep Learning Classification task on [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. We train the data on a two layer Convolutional Neural Network using ReLU as our activation function and Cross Entropy as the Loss function. It is implemented in Tensorflow, using Tensorboard for visualization.
This model was trained on a GPU to obtain 65% accuracy on test data.
